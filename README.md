Query `quser.exe` and return a proper PowerShell Object.
I discussed this [on my blog](http://blog.vertigion.com/2018/04/27/terminal_server_sessions/) to enhance [a StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49042770/615422).
I thought I'd make this into a PowerShell module for ease of use and distribution.
